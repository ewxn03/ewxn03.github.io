            <li>
                <strong>(Personal Project) Download Manager</strong>
                <p>An automation script, written in Python, that automatically organizes files in the downloads directory by grouping them into folders based on their extensions. It features a user-friendly GUI that allows users to add new file mappings and manage existing ones through a JSON file. 
                    The script includes robust error handling and a logging feature that records all changes, facilitating easy monitoring of operations. </p>

                <strong>(Personal Project) Shadow Ban Bot</strong>
                <p>My friends and I, enjoy playing a video game called Call of Duty; unfortunately this game has a ban system based on how many reports
                    are made against you and unfortunately this system can be abused. I created a bot in JavaScript using Puppeteer to input the valid login credentials and then 
                    login, then click on a few more buttons and then web scrape the text in an HTML element to determine if the user is still banned or not as these bans can last anywhere from 
                    48 hours to 2 weeks. This project is still ongoing as I need to implement a system to bypass the reCAPTCHA, at the moment this part needs to be manually done.
                    This project has been extremely challenging and I initially tried to use Selenium to achieve this task but this method led to continuous bot detection. I then rewrote the code in JavaScript
                    using JavaScript and the stealth Puppeteer plugin that bypasses common techniques websites use to detect bots. I aim to use APIs like 2recaptcha to solve my problem
                    in the future. Once I can bypass the reCAPTCHA I can automate the script to run at a certain time of the day each day.

                <strong>(3rd year machine learning project) Loan Status Predictor</strong>
                <p>For our MLG382 module in our third year, me and a team of five other developers were tasked with developing a feature-based loan predictor app using a
                    optimal machine learning algorithm. We had to analyze all the different algorithms and decide on the most optimal 
                solution to the problem. We had to integrate our model with a dash application that would take input from users and then output whether their loan is approved or not. We
                used a variety of python libraries including panda,numpy,matplotlib,seaborn,sk-lit etc to achieve our task. This project taught me a lot considering this was my first time 
                working on a project that involved machine learning and I hope i can carry forward this knowledge into any future machine learning projects I may take on.
